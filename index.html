    <p>This is my first webpage built with HTML as part of my front-end learning journey. </p>
     <p>I am a<strong> pharmacist in the making</strong>and a <strong>tech enthusiast</strong> with a growing passion for <strong>front-end web development</strong>.
My curiosity for how things work and my love for creativity pushed me into tech, where I enjoy bringing ideas to life on the web.</p>
<p>Alongside my academic journey in pharmacy, I have been actively involved in leadership and service.
 Over the years, I have contributed to several committees, including the Welfare Committee and the Electoral Committee. Currently, I serve as 
 the ADMAP (Anti-Drug Misuse and Abuse Program) Coordinator for the University of Ilorin Chapter for the 2025/2026 academic session, where I help
  promote drug abuse awareness and community impact.</p>

<p>I am passionate about growth, learning, and making meaningful contributions—whether in healthcare, technology, or leadership.</p>
